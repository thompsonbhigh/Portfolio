            <p>
                Now in my junior year, I have no doubts about my decision to pursue Computer Science. I enjoy
                my programming courses and often find myself sparking new ideas and projects to build outside
                of class. Last semester, I completed a full-stack development project that became one of the most
                rewarding and enjoyable experiences of my college career. Working in a team environment with
                SCRUM meetings, defined roles, and regular code reviews felt like a true industry experience. It
                strengthened my passion for software development and confirmed that this is the type of work
                and experience I strive to continue pursuing. I am excited to continue my learning while building
                and improving as a developer, and I hope to turn this passion into a long-term career.
