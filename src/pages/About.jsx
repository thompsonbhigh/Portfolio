      <h1 class='text-6xl text-[#DAD2FF]'>Hello, I'm <span class='font-semibold text-purple-500'>Thompson</span></h1>
      <p class='text-[#DAD2FF] mr-50 mt-5'>
            I am a junior Computer Science student at Texas A&M
            University with a strong interest in software development and
            problem-solving. I am driven by a desire to understand
            systems at a fundamental level, from exploring hardware to
            designing and implementing clean and efficient code. I enjoy
            collaborating in team-based environments where ideas, technical
            skills, and perspectives come together to build effective solutions.
      </p>

      <h2 class='text-[#B2A5FF] mt-10 text-4xl'>The Beginning</h2>
      <p class='text-[#DAD2FF] mr-50'>
            I have been fascinated by computers from a young age, often
            wondering how such complex and powerful systems are designed
            and built. Rather than simply using technology, I was driven to
            understand the technology beneath the surface. This curiosity
            guided me toward pursuing Computer Science as both an
            academic focus and a career path.

      <h2 class='text-[#B2A5FF] mt-10 text-4xl'>First Time Coding</h2>
      <p class='text-[#DAD2FF] mr-50'>
		In fourth grade, the class culminated in a final project where we had
         to program a robot to help address an accessibility challenge. My group
          chose to design a robot that could turn on a light switch when someone 
          entered a room, assisting individuals who might not be able to reach it 
          themselves. This was my first time working with code beyond a visual 
          interface, and it made programming feel tangible and impactful. That 
          project played a big role in growing my interest in coding.
      </p>

      <h2 class='text-[#B2A5FF] mt-10 text-4xl'>Growing Interest</h2>
      <p class='text-[#DAD2FF] mr-50'>
		    By seventh grade, my interest in computing had expanded beyond software to the inner workings
            of the machine itself. I wanted to understand what was happening beneath the surface, which led
            me to research computer hardware and ultimately build my own PC. After saving money and
            receiving several components as Christmas gifts, I spent an entire day assembling the system,
            troubleshooting issues, and diagnosing why certain parts were not functioning as expected.
            Through a combination of persistence, trial and error, and countless tutorials, I successfully built
            a fully functioning computer. That experience gave me a stronger appreciation for hardware
            architecture and system integration, and once I understood the physical foundation, I became
            even more motivated to explore how software interfaces with hardware to bring systems to life.
      </p>

      <h2 class='text-[#B2A5FF] mt-10 text-4xl'>The Commitment</h2>
      <p class='text-[#DAD2FF] mr-50'>
		Although I did not spend much time coding during high school, my interest in Computer Science
        never faded. When applying to colleges, I knew this was the field I wanted to pursue. I enrolled
        at Texas A&M University, where students spend their first year in General Engineering before
        applying to a specific major, which allowed me the opportunity to reflect on whether Computer
        Science was truly the right path for me. During my first semester, I took an introductory Python
        course that emphasized teamwork and problem-solving. For the final project, my group and I
        built a simple game, creating a tic-tac-toe–style application. While I had never built a game
        before and was unfamiliar with many of the tools involved, I quickly became fully invested in
        the project. I found myself thinking about bug fixes, feature improvements, and overall design
        well beyond class time. By the end of the project, I realized how much I enjoyed the process. For
        the first time, a school project did not feel like an obligation, it felt like something I wanted to
        continue dedicating my hard work towards.
      </p>

      <h2 class='text-[#B2A5FF] mt-10 text-4xl'>Moving Forward</h2>
      <p class='text-[#DAD2FF] mr-50'>
		Now in my junior year, I have no doubts about my decision to pursue Computer Science. I enjoy
        my programming courses and often find myself sparking new ideas and projects to build outside
        of class. Last semester, I completed a full-stack development project that became one of the most
        rewarding and enjoyable experiences of my college career. Working in a team environment with
        SCRUM meetings, defined roles, and regular code reviews felt like a true industry experience. It
        strengthened my passion for software development and confirmed that this is the type of work
        and experience I strive to continue pursuing. I am excited to continue my learning while building
        and improving as a developer, and I hope to turn this passion into a long-term career.
