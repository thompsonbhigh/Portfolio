      <p class='text-[#DAD2FF] mr-50 mt-5'>
          I’m a junior Computer Science student at Texas A&M University with a strong interest 
          in software development and problem-solving. I enjoy understanding how systems work from the ground up, 
          whether that means exploring hardware, writing clean and efficient code, or collaborating on team-based projects.
      </p>

      <h2 class='text-[#B2A5FF] mt-10 text-4xl'>The Beginning</h2>
      <p class='text-[#DAD2FF] mr-50'>
          I was always fascinated by computers and electronics, constantly wondering how people managed to build such 
          complex and powerful devices. That curiosity, wanting to understand how things worked rather than just use 
          them, set me on the path that eventually led me to Computer Science.

      <h2 class='text-[#B2A5FF] mt-10 text-4xl'>First Time Coding</h2>
      <p class='text-[#DAD2FF] mr-50'>
		My first experience with coding came in second grade, when I was invited to join a small special class focused on basic programming concepts. We met daily and experimented with simple drag-and-drop coding tools. While it was introductory, it sparked something that stuck with me.
		In fourth grade, the class culminated in a final project where we had to program a robot to help address an accessibility challenge. My group chose to design a robot that could turn on a light switch when someone entered a room, assisting individuals who might not be able to reach it themselves. This was my first time working with code beyond a visual interface, and it made programming feel tangible and impactful. That project played a big role in growing my interest in coding.

      <h2 class='text-[#B2A5FF] mt-10 text-4xl'>Growing Interest</h2>
      <p class='text-[#DAD2FF] mr-50'>
		By seventh grade, my interest in computers had expanded beyond software. I wanted to understand what was happening inside the machine itself. I began researching computer hardware and eventually decided to build my own PC. After saving up money and receiving parts for Christmas, I spent most of the day assembling it, troubleshooting issues, and figuring out why certain components weren’t working.
		With a lot of trial and error (and more than a few YouTube tutorials), I successfully built my own computer. That experience gave me a strong appreciation for how hardware works, and once I understood the physical side, I became even more motivated to learn how software could control and bring that hardware to life.

      </p>

      <h2 class='text-[#B2A5FF] mt-10 text-4xl'>The Commitment</h2>
      <p class='text-[#DAD2FF] mr-50'>
		Although I didn’t do much coding during high school, my interest in Computer Science never went away. When it came time to apply to colleges, I knew this was the field I wanted to pursue. I enrolled at Texas A&M University, where students spend their first year in General Engineering before applying to a specific major.
		During that year, I had time to reflect on whether Computer Science was truly the right choice. In my first semester, I took an introductory Python course that focused heavily on teamwork and problem-solving. The final project involved building a game, and our group created a tic-tac-toe–style application. I had never built a game before and was unfamiliar with many of the tools required, but I quickly found myself fully invested.
		I was constantly thinking about how to fix bugs, improve features, and refine the game, even outside of class. By the end of the project, I realized something important: I genuinely enjoyed the process. For the first time, a school project didn’t feel like work; it felt like something I wanted to keep doing.

      </p>

      <h2 class='text-[#B2A5FF] mt-10 text-4xl'>Moving Forward</h2>
      <p class='text-[#DAD2FF] mr-50'>
		Now in my junior year, I haven’t looked back. I genuinely enjoy my programming classes and am always thinking about new ideas and projects to build. Last semester, I completed a full-stack development project, which was easily the most fun I’ve had in college.
		Working in a team environment with SCRUM meetings, defined roles, and frequent code reviews felt like a real professional experience. It reinforced my passion for software development and confirmed that this is the kind of work I want to continue doing. I’m excited to keep learning, building, and growing as a developer, and I hope to make a career out of it.
