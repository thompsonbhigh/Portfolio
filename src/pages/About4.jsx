            <h2>The Commitment</h2>
            <p>
                Although I did not spend much time coding during high school, my interest in Computer Science
                never faded. When applying to colleges, I knew this was the field I wanted to pursue. I enrolled
                at Texas A&M University, where students spend their first year in General Engineering before
                applying to a specific major, which allowed me the opportunity to reflect on whether Computer
                Science was truly the right path for me. During my first semester, I took an introductory Python
                course that emphasized teamwork and problem-solving. For the final project, my group and I
                built a simple game, creating a tic-tac-toe–style application. While I had never built a game
                before and was unfamiliar with many of the tools involved, I quickly became fully invested in
                the project. I found myself thinking about bug fixes, feature improvements, and overall design
                well beyond class time. By the end of the project, I realized how much I enjoyed the process. For
                the first time, a school project did not feel like an obligation, it felt like something I wanted to
                continue dedicating my hard work towards.
