            <p>
                    I have been fascinated by computers from a young age, often
                    wondering how such complex and powerful systems are designed
                    and built. Rather than simply using technology, I was driven to
                    understand the technology beneath the surface. This curiosity
                    guided me toward pursuing Computer Science as both an
                    academic focus and a career path.
